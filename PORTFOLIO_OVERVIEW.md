# Portfolio Modernization Overview

## What Was Done

Your portfolio has been completely rebuilt using modern web technologies:

### Technology Stack

- **Modern CSS** with CSS variables for easy theming

### Key Features

1. **Modern, Clean Design**

   - **Contact**: Contact cards and CTA section

5. **Performance Optimized**

### Project Location

The new portfolio is in: `/tmp/cc-agent/58930243/project/portfolio/`

### Running the Project

```bash
cd portfolio
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in `portfolio/dist/` and can be deployed to any static hosting service.

### Next Steps

1. Replace Pexels placeholder images with your actual project screenshots
2. Update the CV link in Contact component to point to your actual CV
3. Add real project links when available
4. Consider adding a blog section if desired
5. Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages

### Comparison to Original

**Old Portfolio:**
- Plain HTML/CSS/SCSS
- Basic JavaScript for interactions
- Manual responsive design
- Limited animations

**New Portfolio:**
- React + TypeScript architecture
- Component-based, maintainable code
- Advanced animations with Framer Motion
- Modern build pipeline
- Better performance
- Easier to extend and maintain
